Hello, 

If you're looking at this, you're probably wondering why my github is so empty with so many projects listed on my resume pdf. 

Almost all of my work has been in either private GitHub teams or in Bitbucket so alas, my bland profile.

If you would like to know more about the projects that I have worked on, I'd be more than happy to talk about them - drop me an email... danarters (at) gmail.com
